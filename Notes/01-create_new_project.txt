Creating a project with the commend-line
	- Create new folder
	- Craete a new file *.rs
  To compile the file
  	-In the cmd write $ rustc fileName.rs, this will create an executable file,, run it. 


Creating a Project with Cargo
	- "$ cargo new projectName"
	- "$ cd projectName"
  To compile 
  	- "$ cargo build"
  	- To run use "$ cargo run" or run the executable file ./target/debug/fileName.exe 
  	- Use "$ cargo check". This command quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesn’t produce an executable.







cargo doc --open:
You won’t just know which traits to use and which methods and functions to call from a crate. Instructions for using a crate are in each crate’s documentation. Another neat feature of Cargo is that you can run the cargo doc --open command, which will build documentation provided by all of your dependencies locally and open it in your browser.
